      "Singapore FinTech Festival 2020 is confirmed to take place on 7 to 11 December 2020. After careful consideration, we have taken the decision to make SFF x SWITCH 2020 the world’s first week-long round-the-clock, hybrid digital and physical event on 7-11 December. Participants can look forward to a digitally enhanced SFF 2020 that provides a rich immersive experience combining physical and online access. Please rest assured that the decisions we make will always prioritise the well-being and safety of everyone involved – industry partners, customers and event participants. We will continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation, as guided by advisories from the Singapore Government, and observe developments around the world."
